# Lozenge Menu

A trainer (mod menu) for GTA V Singleplayer (story mode).

This script is to supersede `RelationAndRiot` and `YART`, mainly for personal
use. This script is not to compete with any other trainers, nor designed for
use on Multiplayer (in fact, you cannot, all up to date script hooks prevents
this).

## Building

Restore NuGet packages, then build. You'll need Visual Studio 2022, and
.NET Framework 4.8 targeting pack with .NET Desktop workload.

Mono is not supported.

## Usage

Use F7 to open menu.
